**Abstract**: The scholarly debate on voter competence often considers information as a prerequisite for competent decision-making. It is thus assumed that uninformed voters cannot make active decisions, while fully informed citizenry produces the best democratic outcomes. This study assesses these assumptions by constructing a simple voting model, with two groups of voters: informed and uninformed. The analysis revealed that uninformed voters have different motivations to abstain from the election, depending on the electoral context. Specifically, when the voter population has a moderate ideology, high expressive benefit, and low voting cost, uninformed voters abstain independently due to the voting cost from actively delegating electoral decision making to informed voters. Furthermore, the proposed model of endogenous policy-making shows that the high pivotality of uninformed voters can incentivize policymakers to formulate costly but high-quality policies. The results imply that uninformed voting has the potential to improve democratic accountability.
