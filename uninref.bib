Answers emerge from our study of a formal model in which followers face a coordination problem: they wish to choose the best action while conforming as closely as possible to the actions of others. Although they would like to do the right thing and do it together, followers are unsure about the relative merits of their options. They learn about their environment and the likely moves of others by listening to leaders. These leaders bridge differences of opinion and become coordinating focal points. A leader's influence increases with her judgement (her sense of direction) and her ability to convey ideas (her clarity of communication). A leader with perfect clarity enjoys greater influence than one with a perfect sense of direction. When followers choose how much attention to pay to leaders, they listen only to the most coherent communicators. However, power-hungry leaders who need an audience sometimes obfuscate their messages, but less so when their followers place more emphasis on conformity than on doing the right thing.},

	per cent of the reported turnout in the election. The mobilising

Examples show how attending to this distinction overturns conventional wisdom: legislators appear similarly moderate as citizens, not more extreme; however, politically engaged citizens appear especially moderate.},

We study a model of electoral competition with rationally ignorant voters in which the success of a reform is tied to a politician's unobservable competence. We show that when voters' demand for reform is high, candidates engage in a form of populism and propose reformist agendas regardless of their ability to successfully carry them out. As voters are then faced with either risky reformers or policy inaction, the relationship between demand for reform and the probability that any (i.e., genuine or populist) policy change is implemented depends on how harmful botched reforms are.

	demonstrate that the effectiveness of this cue depends upon the endorser's
	incentives and citizens’ levels of sophistication. Specifically,
	I find that under idealized conditions (i.e., when the endorser always
	has an incentive to make truthful statements), this cue dramatically
	improves the decisions of (and closes the gap between) sophisticated
	and unsophisticated subjects. When the endorser's incentives are
	more realistic (i.e., the endorser may have an incentive to lie),
	this cue affects sophisticated versus unsophisticated subjects differently:
	sophisticated subjects do not improve their decisions, whereas unsophisticated
	subjects typically improve their decisions enough to make them comparable
	to sophisticated subjects. Thus, even under more realistic conditions,
	the gap between sophisticated and unsophisticated subjects closes.},

Key experimental results are reported to investigate the extent that bandwagon behavior can be explained by other-regarding preferences in contrast to a psychological desire to simply support a winner. We find support for purely psychological non-other-regarding bandwagon behavior but primarily when subjects have information about the distribution of voter choices in previous elections but individual choices are private. Interestingly, when voting is public this type of bandwagon behavior disappears and bandwagon behavior that could be other-regrading is much higher. Given that observability increases other-regarding behavior in other contexts, our results suggest that some of the observed bandwagon behavior may be explained by other-regarding preferences as well.},

	The potential benefits and costs of five common political heuristics

	to directly observe the use of these five heuristics by voters in
	a mock presidential election campaign. We find that cognitive heuristics
	are at times employed by almost all voters and that they are particularly
	likely to be used when the choice situation facing voters is complex.
	A hypothesized interaction between political sophistication and heuristic
	use on the quality of decision making is obtained across several
	different experiments, however. As predicted, heuristic use generally
	increases the probability of a correct vote by political experts
	but decreases the probability of a correct vote by novices. A situation
	in which experts can be led astray by heuristic use is also illustrated.
	Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for strategies
	to increase input from under-represented groups into the political
	process.},

Recent theoretical work suggests that there are limits on how well this formal accountability links policy decisions to citizen preferences. In particular, incumbents' incentives are driven not by the voters' evaluation of the normative desirability of outcomes but by the outcome's information about the incumbent's type (e.g., competence or ideology). This review surveys both this body of theory and the robust empirical literature it has spawned. It concludes with a short discussion of ongoing work that attempts to integrate this theoretical perspective with a richer view of policy-making institutions. },

	November. This paper argues this trend demonstrates that voters are
	beginning to poll “correctly” ? that is, to ascertain their most-preferred
	candidate. This convergence process is consistent with boundedly
	rational voters making decisions with low information. We examine
	the process by which voters can use opinion polls to guide their

	Bayesian updating assumption. This assumption about the updating
	process is key to many theoretical results which argue that voters
	have the potential to aggregate information via a coordination signal

  abstract  = {I develop a theory where propaganda affects mass behavior without
	necessarily affecting mass beliefs. A group of citizens observe a
	signal of their government's performance, which may be upwardly inflated
	by propaganda. The citizens want to give a higher level of support
	to better performing governments, and also when others provide a
	high level of support (i.e., to coordinate). Some citizens are “credulous”,
	meaning they are unaware that the government can manipulate the signal,
	rendering them easily influenced by propaganda. Due to the coordination
	motive and presence of credulous citizens, even those who know the
	true degree of manipulation (the “informed citizens”) are responsive
	to propaganda. If citizens care mostly about coordination, the informed
	citizens mimic the actions of the credulous types, i.e., all act
	as if they believe the government's lies even though many if not
	most do not. Citizens can also herd on behaving as if they believe
	the government even if none are fooled by propaganda, but some are
	“second-order credulous”, meaning they incorrectly believe that others
	are credulous. The government benefits from this responsiveness to
	manipulation since it leads to a more compliant citizenry, but tends
	to use more propaganda precisely when citizens are less responsive.},

	cues and information shortcuts to behave as if they were fully informed.
	Failing that, individual deviations from fully informed voting cancel
	out in a mass electorate, producing the same aggregate election outcome
	as if voters were fully informed. Hypothetical "fully informed" vote
	choices are imputed to individual voters using the observed relationship
	between political information and vote choices for voters with similar
	social and demographic characteristics, estimated by probit analysis
	of data from National Election Study surveys conducted after the
	six most recent United States presidential elections. Both hypotheses
	are clearly disconfirmed. At the individual level, the average deviation
	of actual vote probabilities from hypothetical "fully informed" vote
	probabilities was about ten percentage points. In the electorate
	as a whole, these deviations were significantly diluted by aggregation,
	but by no means eliminated: incumbent presidents did almost five

	percentage points better, than they would have if voters had in fact

  abstract  = {Voters face difficult choices in local elections, where information
	about candidates is scarce and party labels often do not distinguish
	candidates’ ideological positions. Can voters choose candidates who
	represent them ideologically in these contexts? To address this question,
	we conduct original surveys that ask candidates in the 2011 mayoral
	election in San Francisco to take positions on local policy issues.
	We ask voters their positions on these same policy issues on a written
	exit poll. We use these policy positions to construct comparable
	measures of candidate and voter ideology (i.e., ideal points). Within
	the exit poll, we experimentally manipulate cues to examine their
	effects on voters’ candidate preferences. We observe a strong, positive
	relationship between voter ideology and the ideology of the candidates
	they choose in the election. However, our experiments show that endorsements
	from political parties and newspapers with ideological reputations
	weaken this relationship. These findings challenge the view of local
	elections as nonideological and demonstrate that spatial voting theory
	can be usefully applied to local settings. They also indicate that
	voters may not treat political party and newspaper endorsements as
	signals of candidates’ ideological positions, but rather as nonideological
	signals of partisan affinity or candidate quality/viability.},

  abstract  = {Interest in the concept of identity has grown exponentially within both the humanities and social sciences, but the discussion of identity has had less impact than might be expected on the quantitative study of political behavior in general and on political psychology more specifically. One of the approaches that holds the most promise for political psychologists is social identity theory, as reflected in the thinking of Henri Tajfel, John Turner, and colleagues. Although the theory addresses the kinds of problems of interest to political psychologists, it has had limited impact on political psychology because of social identity theorists' disinclination to examine the sources of social identity in a real world complicated by history and culture. In this review, four key issues are examined that hinder the successful application of social identity theory to political phenomena. These key issues are the existence of identity choice, the subjective meaning of identities, gradations in identity strength, and the considerable stability of many social and political identities.},

  abstract  = {Preventing climate change and damage from natural disasters typically requires policies with up-front costs that promise a flow of benefits over time. Why has obtaining such policies in a competitive electoral democracy proved so intractable? We develop a formal model of electoral accountability in this context, in which politicians have private information about their motivations. The model shows why fully rational voters, though certain that incumbents spend less on disaster prevention than is good for them, reelect incumbents at very high rates. In addition, in such equilibria, voters would punish incumbents who spent more on disaster prevention. This equilibrium is consistent with (and implies) some of the major empirical regularities observed in the literature on voting and disaster prevention. We discuss some implications of our analysis for advancing public debates about disaster and climate change mitigation.},
